I created this image for my first Asus X540Y laptop. 
Since it is not very powerful, it will not be able to run Windows 10 or other Linux distributions properly, so I took the issue of choosing an operating system seriously and, having studied the topic of creating a custom Debian build, created this custom image. 
I hope my experience will be useful to someone.
